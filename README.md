# Aquarium mod
A mindustry mod that adds turrets using scripts. If you have any problems or a suggestion you can tell me either here via an issue or via discord blool#2368. Please keep in mind that this mod is still Work In Progress so anything may be subject to change.

# Content

- Color turrets:
6 turrets, 2 for each of the three colors Red Green and Blue.
Red turrets shoots fire bursts that backfire to the turret when despawned (like a frag backwards).
Green turrets shoots slow but powerfull AOE bombs.
Blue turrets shoots special shaped projectiles like tridents and harpoons.

- Star turrets:
3 turrets, star themed.
Polaris shoots small homing stardust particles for very little power and materials.
Regil bombards enemies with AOE stardust particles.
Antares casts a lot of small lasers around itself with a massive laser occasionaly.

- Other turrets:
Gale - a Scatter upgrade that focuses more on single target damage over group damage, can only target airbone enemies.

# Future plans

- Polish a bit of the effects and overall game-feel
- More flak weaponry (like Gale and Scatter)
- Better icon and a banner
